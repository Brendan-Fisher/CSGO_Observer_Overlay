Rename team one logo to "teamOneLogo.png"

Rename team two logo to "teamTwoLogo.png"

in config.json, place team one name under after "teamOne": in QUOTES
same for team two

if team one starts CT, no work needed besides pressing ` in OBS/StreamLabs whenever teams swap
if team one starts T, press ` and 0 at beginning of match, and then ` whenever teams swap

example:
{
  "teamOne": "Gator Esports",
  "teamTwo": "NYU"
