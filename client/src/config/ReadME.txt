Rename team one logo to "teamOneLogo.png"

Rename team two logo to "teamTwoLogo.png"

in config.json, place team one name under after "teamOne": in QUOTES
same for team two

make sure teamOne is ALWAYS the team that is on the left side [team that starts CT]
and teamTwo is ALWAYS team that starts on right side [team that starts T]

example:
{
  "teamOne": "Gator Esports",
  "teamTwo": "NYU"
}
